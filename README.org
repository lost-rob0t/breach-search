* BreachSearch
This was my 3rd gen of databreach searching. its very fast.

if it works it works, its old code i uploaded.

The next time i do this will be with lmdb for even faster sorting and search.

** install

with nimble

#+begin_src shell
nimble install https://github.com/lost-rob0t/breach-search.git
#+end_src

From git
#+begin_src shell
git clone https://github.com/lost-rob0t/breach-search.git
cd breach-search
nimble install
#+end_src


** usage

Check the config for how to use it
Make sure to set the ~imported~ field to false, it will ignore sources that have been imported.
#+begin_src shell
BreachSearch --config config.json

I dont think i added searching?
i can add it if people open issues
